# 02 Properties

In this sample we will introduce a basic React concept, handling propertiers and
callbacks.

We will add a _username_ property and display it in the helloWorld component,
then we will create a second component that will let the user change the default
name to another one and notify the parent control about it.

We will take a startup point sample _01 Hello React_:

Summary steps:

- Move _helloworld_ stateless component to standard class component.
- Create a property that will hold the _username_ value.
- Let's inform it from our parent control.
- Let's create an _EditName_ control.
- Let's instantiate it in the root control and wire it up.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.6.0) if they are not already installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content from _01 HelloReact_ and execute _npm install_.
