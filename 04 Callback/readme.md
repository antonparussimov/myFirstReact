# 04 Callback + State

In this sample we are going to refactor the previous sample **03 State**.

We'll update the name property only when the user clicks on
a _change_ button, we will simplify the event itself as well.

Obviously, we will take the sample **03 State** as a starting point.

Summary steps:

- Add a button to the `EditName` component and a handler function for this.
- Submit the name only when the user clicks on the button.
- Update the `app` component to handle the new simplified event.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.6.0) if they are not already installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of the `03 State` folder to an empty folder for the sample
and make this your current folder.

- Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

 ```bash
 $ npm install
 ```

- Since we are going to use an internal handler, we'll transform the `NameEditComponent`
from a stateless component into a class component, then we will add some refactor on the naming.

 The `nameEdit.tsx` file should looks like this:

 ```javascript
 import * as React from 'react';

 interface Props {
   initialUserName: string;
   onNameUpdated: (newName: string) => any;
 }

 interface State {
   editingName: string;
 }

 export class NameEditComponent extends React.Component<Props, State> {

   constructor(props: Props) {
     super(props);
     // Watch out what would happen if we get this user name via an AJAX callback
     // you will find a different implementatin on 05 sample
     this.state = {editingName: this.props.initialUserName};
   }

   onChange(event: any): any {
     this.setState({editingName: event.target.value} as State);
   }

   onNameSubmit(event: any): any {
         this.props.onNameUpdated(this.state.editingName);
   }

   public render() {
     return (
       <div>
         <label>Update Name:</label>
         <input value={this.state.editingName} onChange={this.onChange.bind(this)} />
         <input type="submit" value="Change" className="btn btn-default" onClick={this.onNameSubmit.bind(this)} />
       </div>
     );
   }

 }
 ```

- Let's wire this up in the `app.tsx` file.

 ```javascript
 export class App extends React.Component<Props, State> {

   constructor(props: Props) {
     super(props);
     this.state = {userName: "defaultUserName"};
   }

   setUsernameState(newName: string) {
     this.setState({userName: newName});
   }

   public render() {
     return (
       <div>
         <HelloComponent userName={this.state.userName} />
         <NameEditComponent initialUserName={this.state.userName} onNameUpdated={this.setUsernameState.bind(this)} />
       </div>
     );
   }

 }
 ```

 Now we've got a clear event, strongly typed and simplified (straight forward).

- Let's give it a try:

 ```bash
 $ npm start
 ```

- Then, load http://localhost:8080/ in a browser to see the output.

 Now, the greeting only change when the user clicks on the change button.
